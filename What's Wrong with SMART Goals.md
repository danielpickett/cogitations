There is no requirement that they be important, relevant, or ultimately contribute to reaching toward the company's "true north" (i.e., mission).
 
They work best only in stable environments, where more efficient execution of known tasks is preferable. For example, "Increase number of followers on company Twitter account by 15 percent before July 1" presupposes that Twitter has been a good source leads/PR in the past and more of the same is desirable. This doesn't leave a lot of room for just figuring out what needs to be done, so it doesn't work very well in environments where one still needs to figure out what's important. Or if the performance metrics are unknown.

They don't work very well for lofty goals. Lofty goals may involve just a generally idea that a general direction should be pursued. Since the specifics about how to move in that direction are constantly changing (indeed, those specifics are the thing that needs to be figured out), SMART goals can lead us to ignore the pursuit of that lofty goal, since we don't know how to measure it or how to estimate how long it will take.
